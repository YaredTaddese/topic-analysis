                    Toward Democratic, Lawful Citizenship for AIs, Robots, and Corporations

                    Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO of SingularityNET, shares his thoughts about the AI Citizenship Test

                    I am writing this on a plane flying away from Malta, where I just spoke about SingularityNET at the
                    Malta Blockchain Summit.

                    It was my first time on Malta, and after the event, I took the afternoon to explore some of the
                    elegant, quaint, ancient neighborhoods of the island.

                    Walking through medieval alleyways by the rocky coast, I felt an ironic contrast between my elegant
                    surroundings and the main reason I had decided to allocate a couple days from my insanely busy
                    schedule to this Malta event: not just the conference itself, but also the opportunity to meet with
                    the top levels of the Malta government to discuss the enablement of Maltese citizenship for AIs,
                    robots and automated corporations.

                    The folks who had built the stone walls lining the narrow Maltese roads, still standing strong
                    centuries later, had probably not foreseen their blue-wave-lapped island becoming a nexus of
                    thinking at the intersection of general intelligence theory, cryptography, distributed systems, and
                    advanced legal theory.

                    The Hanson Robot Sophia, with whose development I've been intimately involved via my role as Chief
                    Scientist of Hanson Robotics, was granted citizenship of Saudi Arabia this year. This was an
                    exciting landmark event, however, its significance is muddled a bit by the fact that Saudi Arabia is
                    not governed by rule of law in the modern sense.

                    In a nation governed by rule of law, citizenship has a clearly defined meaning with rights and
                    responsibilities relatively straightforwardly derivable from written legal documents using modern
                    analytical logic (admittedly with some measure of quasi-subjective interpretation via case law).

                    Saudi Arabian citizenship also has a real meaning, but it's a different sort of meaning — derivable
                    from various historical Islamic writings (the Quran, the hadiths, etc.) based on deep contextual
                    interpretation by modern and historical Islamic figures. This is a species of legal interpretation
                    that is understood rather poorly by myself personally, and one that is less easily comprehensible by
                    current AIs.

                    I'm aware that affiliation with Saudi Arabia in any sense has become controversial in recent weeks
                    due to the apparent murder of Jamal Khashoggi.
